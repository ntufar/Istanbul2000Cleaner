A virus cleaner I wrote back in 1998.

Our university lab computers were booting off NetWare network disks. They 
were read-only and they had a virus on them. I remeber it being called 
Istanbul 2000 but the only reference to it I could find is this:

I tried to onvince our lab administrators that we have a virus on network 
disks but they assured me that we use NetWare and there can be no viruses
on netware.

So I had no other choice than to write virus cleaner myself. It is a small
Assembler program that cleans up the virus and put a signature in memory so
that when the real virus starts I fool it into believing that the system
is already infected.
